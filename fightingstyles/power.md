## Power Fighting Style

This fighting style applies to using a weapon from a single [weapon group](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/variant/buildingCharacters/weaponGroupFeats.htm),
generally two-handed. 
Weapon Focus and its successors apply to a single weapon group. 
Note that this style captures many feats that have limited practicality. Perhaps now they might be used on occasion.
